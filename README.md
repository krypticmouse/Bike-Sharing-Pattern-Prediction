# Bike-Sharing-Pattern-Prediction
## Further Explanation
The Neural network was built from "scratch", using only NumPy to assist. The goal of this project is to understand what happens behind the neural network before diving deeper into other tools like TensorFlow.

## Conclusion
The predictions given by the model are quite accurate. However, the model overestimes bike ridership in December because it hasn't had sufficient holiday season training examples.
